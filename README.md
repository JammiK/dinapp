What is DINAPP?
---------------
DINAPP is the monetization platform based on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows to sell digital contents from inside of your application and acquire revenue in ethereum coins. You can use this platform to sell a wide range of content, including downloadable content such as media files or photos, virtual content such as game levels or potions, premium services and features, and more.

##### Supported types of in-app purchases:
* Permanent subscription 
* Time-limited subscription
* Standard in-app products

When you use the DINAPP platform to sell an item, whether it's an in-app product or a subscription, DINAPP handles all checkout details so your application never has to directly process any ethereum transactions.
